# STM32F746-DISCO with Camera, running Convolutional Neural Network software from ARM CMSIS-NN library

The program take fomr the cameraimage a snapshot 128x128 pixel, then convert this snap to an image of 32x32 pixel format, to feed the CIFAR10 example program.

Each image is processed on about 150ms. I will post soon the code.
