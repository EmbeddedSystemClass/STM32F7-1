# STM32F746-DISCO with Camera, running Convolutional Neural Network software from ARM CMSIS-NN library

The program take from the camera an image snapshot of 128x128 pixel, then convert this snap to an image of 32x32 pixel format, to feed the CIFAR10 example program.

Each image is processed on about 150ms. I will post the code soon.
